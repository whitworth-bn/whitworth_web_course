                Joy! You truly live up to your name.
                You radiate light and warmth in a way that has always stood out to me. When I took your Interpersonal
                Communication class five years ago, I didn&#39;t know just how much it would impact me. Not just the
                content, but you—your presence, your smile, your ability to work with anyone.

                Before your class, I was honestly more mean-spirited. I struggled socially, and I didn&#39;t know how to
                connect with people. But you taught me, both through the curriculum and by example. You helped me
                believe that people could choose joy and that it could be powerful and inviting.

                I grew up poor, in violent environments, experiencing homelessness and constant instability. I
                didn&#39;t understand what I was doing wrong. But being in your class helped me start to figure it
                out—and I&#39;ve carried that with me ever since.

                Thank you for helping me become the man I am today.
