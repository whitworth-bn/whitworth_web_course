                Edna,
                Congratulations on your new baby—I&#39;m so happy for you! I&#39;m sure you receive a ton of thank-you
                notes, but I really hope this one sticks with you.

                Though we never had a deeply personal conversation due to my hectic schedule, I&#39;ve admired you from
                the classroom for the past two years. Your teaching style, your humor, your clarity—it all just clicks.
                You “get it.” You&#39;ve been one of the professors I&#39;ve always felt a natural connection with, and
                that&#39;s rare.

                It&#39;s truly been a privilege to learn from you. If you&#39;re open to it, I&#39;d love to keep in
                touch—maybe grab lunch sometime after graduation?

                Thank you again. You&#39;ve made a real difference in my life.
            </p>
