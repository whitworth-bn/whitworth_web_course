                Staci! My favorite front desk lady on this campus.
                We haven&#39;t talked a ton, but you&#39;ve always stood out to me. Whether it was offering me a
                notecard, answering my questions, or just smiling as I walked past—you&#39;ve consistently been a safe
                and welcoming presence.

                Your warmth is contagious, and I honestly think people like you are what make Whitworth feel like a
                community. Thank you for being exactly who you are. You matter more than you probably know.
            </p>
