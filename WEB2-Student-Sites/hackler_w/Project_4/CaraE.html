                Cara, thank you so much for hiring me in the library in the first place.
                You have opened the door for me to meet some incredible people, find a safe and quiet space to exist
                while finishing my time at whitworth.
                I was always afraid of the library and never thought it would be the place for me, but once you took a
                chance on me, I got to learn that not only is the library the place for me, but how expansive it really
                is.
                It encouraged me to read more, to understand how to support a library and how important you are. You
                have changed my life for the better and I am beyond grateful so thank you.
            </p>
