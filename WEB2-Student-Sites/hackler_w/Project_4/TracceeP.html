                Traccee, thank you for sticking with me through every wild schedule change I threw your way.
                Over time, I noticed—and appreciated—that you started recognizing me, cheering me on, and always
                checking in on how close I was to graduation.
                I know your job at the registrar&#39;s office isn&#39;t easy, but your consistency and kindness never
                went unnoticed. You rooted for me when I wasn&#39;t sure I could finish, and that quiet encouragement
                made a difference. Thank you for helping me cross the finish line.
            </p>
