                Phillip, hands down the friendliest security officer on campus.
                Even though we had a playful debate about the electric vehicle parking situation, I genuinely
                appreciated our interactions—whether we were closing the library together, unlocking a building, or
                sorting out campus logistics.
                You showed up with professionalism, humor, and grace every time. It might not always be visible, but
                your work matters. And I see it. Thank you for all you do.
            </p>
