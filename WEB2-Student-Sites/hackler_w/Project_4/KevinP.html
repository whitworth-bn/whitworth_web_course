                Kevin,
                You taught me that sometimes the “abnormal” way of teaching is actually the most effective. Your
                leadership class carved out space in my heart.

                As you may remember, I work at a nonprofit for at-risk youth. Your class gave me the confidence to lean
                into my own leadership style—one that&#39;s more flexible, more intuitive, more human. You showed me
                that being hands-off while still being present is a powerful approach.

                Growing up, I didn&#39;t have the most stable or supportive environment. Social situations were hard,
                and I often felt like I didn&#39;t belong anywhere. Your class gave me a safe place to experiment, to
                open up, and to see people (and myself) in a new light.

                Thank you for creating a space where I could try, fail, and grow.
            </p>
