                I didn&#39;t visit the coffee shop a lot during my time at Whitworth, but when I did—especially on
                breaks between classes—seeing you was a joy. Your small acts of kindness, your smile, your energy...
                they helped me feel grounded.
                You reminded me that there are allies on campus—people who see us, who support us, even in the tiniest
                interactions. Thank you for being that kind of person. Maybe someday, I can return the kindness and take
                you out for coffee.
                I know this message is very simple but please pat yourself on your back. You helped me a lot and I am
                very greatful.
