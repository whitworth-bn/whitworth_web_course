                Alex, thank you for giving me the grace, the kindness, and the patience these last few years.
                I know you have always done your best to listen to ideas that are not yours, were very open and kind
                about everything, and always did your best to be good.
                Although we do not live very similar lives, you have broaden my perspective on all sorts of topics in my
                life.
                Honestly, you are the only person I really trust to talk about anything around christians because you
                take the time to understand and you have given me a more positive outlook on religion, human kind, and
                myself in a less nihilistic way.
                So Thank you deeply, this has been a long struggle in my life. I will never forget your help for helping
                me pass and understand my biblical classes. Also I wanted to say thank you for letting me have safety
                and security even when I was not at my best.
                My life hasnt really ever been easy, but knowing I always had a place to rely on really lightened my
                load over these last few years and words can not express the amount of good that has done for me. So
                thank you.
                Alex, I meant what I said in my earlier message, but I wanted to add more. You have a deep and
                unshakable belief in people, and even when I was too tired to believe in myself, you still showed up and
                saw potential.
                You made me feel like I was part of something real, like my dreams weren&#39;t impossible—they just
                needed structure and support. You made space for chaos, for creativity, and for honest messiness.
                You didn&#39;t try to change me—you amplified the best parts of me. Thank you for championing the
                library, and for giving me a place to be all of myself. I won&#39;t forget it.
