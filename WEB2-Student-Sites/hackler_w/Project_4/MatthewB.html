            <p>
                Matthew, your ideas are some of the most exciting, fun, and deeply human I&#39;ve encountered during my
                time earning my bachelor&#39;s.
                I regret not having more time to talk to you about your theories or connect more on how we see the
                world, because I truly felt a spark of recognition in your approach to learning. I only had one class
                with you, but that class left an impact.
                Every time I think about the work you&#39;re doing and the joy you bring to students, it makes me smile.
                I hope this message returns just a small fraction of the joy you&#39;ve sparked in others. Thank you for
                being exactly who you are.
            </p>
