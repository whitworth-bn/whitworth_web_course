                Peter!! I DID IT—I&#39;m graduating!!! And you are a big part of the reason why.
                You are the most fun professor in the CS department, and one of the most reliable, consistent presences
                I&#39;ve had here.
                I&#39;ve fallen many times during my college journey, and you never hesitated to help me get back up.
                Your attitude never shifted based on the day—you always showed up, patient, steady, and willing to help.
                I passed comp sci because you didn&#39;t let me quit. You taught me that learning takes persistence and
                compassion.
                You&#39;ve done an amazing job, and I hope you know how many students feel seen because of you. Like I
                told Scott, if you're open to it, I&#39;d love to take you both out for one celebratory drink—because
                you deserve it.
