                Hi Ruth!
                We didn&#39;t get to connect much outside of me taking my tests in the separate room, but I want you to
                know that your presence has always stood out to me.

                You&#39;ve always been so bright, welcoming, and genuinely kind. That alone made a difference in my
                day-to-day experience at Whitworth. Keep doing what you&#39;re doing—because it matters.

                Thank you for being a light.
            </p>
