                Karin, you are the fiercest, most inspiring person I&#39;ve met here. I know I had a bit too much to say
                during your class, but as a gay man in this space, your presence meant everything.
                You showed me that religion and resistance can live side-by-side, and that people like us can demand
                equity and be heard. You made space for honesty. For growth.
                For fire. You gave me courage—to speak, to act, to learn with more tact, and to stand up when it
                mattered. You showed me that growing older can mean growing stronger. Thank you for fighting so students
                like me could learn in the light of your fire.
            </p>
