                Anthony and Amanda!
                I hope you don&#39;t mind the combined message, but you&#39;re the ultimate library power couple. Your
                love for each other and your passion for your work radiate every time I see you.

                Even when delivering bad news, you do it with a smile and a spunky tone that makes everything feel
                manageable. You've both created such a welcoming environment that made the library feel like a second
                home for me.

                Thank you for your support, your energy, and your warmth. You&#39;ve meant more to me than you probably
                realize.
            </p>
