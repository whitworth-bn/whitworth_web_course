                Erica,
                I honestly don&#39;t think there are words big enough to express what you&#39;ve meant to me. You are a
                rock, a badass, a powerhouse, and one of the most beautiful souls I&#39;ve met here.

                From the very beginning, you helped guide me to where I needed to be. You taught me the little things
                about how to move through the world professionally, but more importantly—you gave me permission to just
                be me. You told me I mattered. That changed everything.

                I know I&#39;m not the only one you&#39;ve done this for, but to me? You are the biggest celebrity on
                this campus. Every interaction I&#39;ve had with you has left me feeling seen, empowered, and genuinely
                cared for.

                You&#39;ve never judged me (at least not to my face), and even when I made mistakes, you just met me
                with kindness and constructive guidance. It would mean a lot to me to stay in contact after I graduate.
                Maybe grab a coffee and catch up now and then?

                I&#39;d also love your thoughts on where you see my strengths and where I could continue to grow.
                You&#39;ve already shaped so much of my journey—I&#39;d love your insight for the road ahead.
