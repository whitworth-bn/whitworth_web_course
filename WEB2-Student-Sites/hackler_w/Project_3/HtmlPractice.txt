  <h2>Hi there this is my research phase for html</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I have been struggling with coding for a long time now, and I recently learned that HTML actually makes a bit of sense.
  At this point in my life, I need to focus on the basics and making sure I master the concepts before I go in and add new languages
  like CSS or JavaScript. So this page works as a little cheat sheet for my lil coding world. Here I have gone through every section
  of W3 Schools to learn about/refresh myself in HTML.</p>

  <h2>This is a Heading "Hello World"</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph."Hello World"</p>
  <br>

  <!-- These headings go from 1-6. Basically means bolding letters in diff sizes. goes from 1-6 -->
  <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
  <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
  <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
  <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
  <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
  <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
  <br>

  <!-- I always forget how to do links -->
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a basic link</a>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">BLANK - opens in a new tab</a>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_self">SELF - opens in the same tab</a>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_parent">PARENT - opens in parent frame</a>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_top">TOP - opens in the full body of the window</a>

  <!-- I've never learned about block quotes before, they naturally indent the text -->
  <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
  <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
    For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
