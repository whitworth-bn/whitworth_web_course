            <h2>What brought me to Whitworth?</h2>
            <p id="text">
                The day I knew I was going to Whitworth was when my soccer coach created a personalized campus tour
                of his favorite spots.
                I felt a sense of community and belonging and knew that God was guiding me to take a leap of faith.
                <br><br>
                I was admitted into Whitworth with design/architectural interests, and I grew passionate about the
                <strong>Technology and Design</strong> realm.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>"Where do you want me to be, Lord? How can I serve? How can I use my gifts to help people?"</em>
                I prayed and reflected, growing a passionate heart to serve and make the most of the
                <sup>opportunities</sup> blessed to me.
            </p>

            <h2>Why did I choose my major?</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up, I dreamed of becoming an architect, inspired by my father, a welder who brought his sketches
                to
                life.
                However, the <sub>COVID-19</sub> pandemic disrupted pivotal high school experiences,
                and I realized I didn't enjoy my online AP Statistics and AP Calculus classes.
                <br><br>
                I found my passion in <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>, where I balance user-centric design
                with
                software problem-solving and <em>ethnographic research</em>.
                It's a field that allows me to merge creativity with technology.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Technology should support human flourishing, not dictate it."
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>
                After graduation, I plan to work as a <strong>UX/UI designer</strong>, reimagining how humans interact
                with
                technology.
                I hope to contribute to digital experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and impactful.
