	<h3>
	The scope of this project is to redesign an old and outdated site in a modern light. The site that I chose to rebrand from Archive.org is BestBuy.com. For this site, I decided not to look at the current Best Buy site at all.<br>The purpose for doing this was to not recreate the site that they currently use, and therefore end up with nothing unique. The site that I created was derived from many ideas on the internet sourced from searched such as, "ecommerce sites", "checkout pages", "about us pages", and other searches that helped me with ideation. I decided to redesign the home page, shopping cart, product page, and about us pages. For the majority of these pages, <br>I just layed out the elements where I thought they should naturally go, then I took inspiration from common ecommerce sites such as Amazon and Newegg. Overall, I think that the project came out really well and I conviced<br> myself multiple times that it was a real site, at times finding myself clicking the "quantity" dropdown in order to change the number... They did not work in a static prototype, but my brain thought that the page was real. The<br> main tool that I used to create the mockup is Figma. It was not my first time on Figma, but I learned a lot through this process and enjoyed it.
