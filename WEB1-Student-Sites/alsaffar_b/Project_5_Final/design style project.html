    <!-- Section 1: Description of Broken Grid Web Design -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Broken Grid Web Design?</h2>
        <p>
            Broken Grid Design is a modern design trend that subverts traditional grid layouts. In a broken grid design, elements are arranged in a seemingly chaotic manner but are structured in a way that still guides the user’s eye through the page. The layout typically includes overlapping elements, unconventional placements, and asymmetry. Despite its visual randomness, the style remains intentional, creating a dynamic, visually engaging experience. This approach challenges the rigidity of traditional grids and embraces more fluid, organic compositions, often allowing the designer to inject personality and uniqueness into the interface.
        </p>

        <h3>Characteristics of Broken Grid Web Design:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> The layout often lacks symmetry, with elements offset from one another.</li>
            <li><strong>Unconventional Alignments:</strong> Elements may float or be misaligned, but are carefully placed to create visual interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Layering:</strong> Layers of content often overlap, providing depth.</li>
            <li><strong>Whitespace:</strong> Use of generous whitespace or negative space creates contrast and allows the design to breathe.</li>
            <li><strong>Unexpected Movement:</strong> Some elements may appear to shift, as if they belong to a more organic or dynamic structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Bold Typography:</strong> A distinct emphasis on bold and large typography that stands out.</li>
        </ul>
