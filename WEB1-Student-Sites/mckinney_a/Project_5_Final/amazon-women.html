    <h1>The Myth of the Amazon Women</h1>
    <p>
        Amazon women are a legendary group of female warriors known for their strength, courage, and independence.
        Originating from Greek mythology, these women were believed to live in a society free from men and were often depicted
        as powerful fighters in epic tales.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Amazons were known for their combat skills, riding horses, and mastering archery. They symbolized female power and resistance
        against oppression in male-dominated societies.
