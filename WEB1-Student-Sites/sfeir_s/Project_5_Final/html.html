<h1> This is my final for Web Design 1 !</h1>
	<p> I chose to design a website that goes over basics of printmaking. Printmaking is a medium that I have really been loving recently so i thought it would be fun to try and mimick some of the techniques within the design of the website. I made a four page spread and i did so using illustrator.</p>
