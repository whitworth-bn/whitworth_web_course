	<h1> THIS IS MY WEBSITE REDESIGN</h1>
	<p> I chose to redesign the Dr. Martens Website from 2014! I really love this company and the brand's whole aesthetic so it was something that peeked my interest. Although I couldn't find much from the brand's history based on early 2000's website design, the 2014 website is still a testament to the times. It is very maximalist and kind of busy. It is similar to the way that I enjoy collaging in design but maybe just has too much going on. </p>
