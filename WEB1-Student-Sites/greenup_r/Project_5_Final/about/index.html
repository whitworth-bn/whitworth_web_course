			<h1>Life Together in Pursuit of Jesus</h1>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<p>Emmaus is a year-long communal discipleship program. Jesus calls us to follow him with our whole selves – body, soul, mind and spirit. In Emmaus we take this call seriously.</p>
			<p>But following Jesus can be hard, especially in today’s world, especially as a college student.</p>
			<p>This is why in Emmaus we dedicate one year to live in intentional Christian community. During this year of communal living we commit to a rhythm of spiritual practices, worship, biblical reflection and service. In other words, we commit to following Jesus with our whole selves.</p>
			<p>In the process, we will grow in our love for God, develop more robust spiritual lives and be transformed in the image of Christ. In short, we will learn what it means to be faithful disciples of Jesus.</p>

			<h1>About the name "Emmaus"</h1>
			<div class="break"></div>
			<p>At the end of Luke's gospel (24:13-35), two of Jesus' followers encounter a stranger as they walk toward the village of Emmaus. Under the stranger's guidance, the disciples dwell on the story of God's faithfulness told throughout Scripture. The disciples don't want the stranger to go on alone, so they invite him into their home. When they sit down together to break bread, their world is turned upside down. They see that this stranger is Jesus himself. This gift is simultaneously a task, for the disciples are immediately compelled to share the good news with others. In these ways, the Emmaus story provides a compelling model for Christian discipleship. Following Jesus requires us to care for the stranger, to offer hospitality, to think deeply about Scripture, to gather in community and to participate in God's mission of redemption. This holistic pattern of discipleship is our Emmaus Way.</p>
