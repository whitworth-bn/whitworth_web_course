      <p>
        Forests are some of the most vital and vibrant ecosystems on our planet. They regulate our climate, purify our
        air and water, support countless species, and provide essential resources for billions of people. Yet despite
        their importance, forests face increasing pressure from deforestation, exploitation, and climate change. This
        page explores the many roles forests play in maintaining life on Earth — and the urgent need to protect them.

      <h1>Forests are home to over 80% of the world's land-based species of animals, plants and insects</h1>
      <p>
        These animals help to keep the forest healthy. For example, elephants distribute seeds from fruits they have
        eaten.
        When the seeds pass through their gut, they come out undigested in their dung, and germinate in the ground.

      <h1>Forests can make rain</h1>
      <p>
        Over three-quarters of the world’s accessible freshwater comes from rivers in or around forests. Forests also
        move so
        much water from the soil into the atmosphere that they create rain. Parts of the Amazon actually trigger their
        own
        rainy season.

      <h1>We still don't know all there is to know about our forests</h1>
      <p>
        We don’t know how many tree species there are on Earth, but scientists estimate there are about 63,000 known
        species.
        There could be as many as 9,000 tree species still unknown to science.

      <h1>Forests are incredibly good at storing carbon</h1>
      <p>
        Most of this carbon storage takes place underground. For example, in UK forests, around 70% of carbon stored is
        kept
        in the soil. The rest is stored in the roots, surface litter and the tree above ground.

      <h1>Our tropical forests store about one-third as much carbon as is held in the atmospheren</h1>
      <p>
        Around 30% of all the carbon reserved in the world's forests is stored in the forests of South America - around
        82
        gigatonnes.

      <h1>Forests once covered just under half of the earth's land</h1>
      <p>
        The total number of trees has fallen by nearly half since the start of human civilisation and it's estimated
        that over
        15 billion trees are cut down each year. That’s around 100,000 square kilometres of forest, or roughly one
        football
        pitch every two seconds.

      <h1>Our food system is the biggest driver of forest loss</h1>
      <p>
        Up to 80% of deforestation worldwide happens to make room for crops and livestock
        Palm Oil - palm fruit, having been harvested is piled up in order to be weighed.

      <h1>In 2018 the UK was the second largest net importer of forest products in the world, surpassed only by China
      </h1>
      <p>
        To supply the annual UK demand for just seven products (beef and leather, timber, soy, palm oil, pulp and paper,
        cocoa, and rubber) requires a land area of almost 90% of the size of the UK. Nearly 30% of this land is in
        countries
        at high risk of deforestation.

      <h1>People are responsible for around three-quarters of all wildfires</h1>
      <p>
        Between 2001 and 2015 23% of global forest loss was due to wildfires.

      <h1>Deforestation releases carbon dioxide that has been stored as carbon in trees, roots and soil, making climate
        change worse</h1>
      <p>
        This creates a feedback loop, as climate change increases the likelihood of deforestation, as the risk of
        droughts,
        wildfires and pest infestations increases and stresses the forest ecosystem. There is simply no way we can fight
        the
        climate crisis if we don’t stop deforestation.
