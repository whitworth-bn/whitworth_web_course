      <h1>Growing Deserts</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        It's hard to imagine that global warming would have much effect on the world's already hot deserts. But even
        small
        changes in temperature or precipitation could drastically impact plants and animals living in the desert. In
        some
        cases global warming is predicted to increase the area of deserts, which already cover a quarter of Earth.
        <br><br>
        Human activities such as firewood gathering and the grazing of animals are also converting semiarid regions into
        deserts, a process known as desertification. Population growth and greater demand for land are serious obstacles
        in
        the effort to combat this problem.

      <p>
        Global warming is increasing the incidence of drought, which dries up water holes. Higher temperatures may
        produce
        an
        increasing number of wildfires that alter desert landscapes by eliminating slow-growing trees and shrubs and
        replacing
        them with fast-growing grasses.

        <br><br>
        Irrigation used for agriculture may in the long term lead to salt levels in the soil that become too high to
        support
        plants. Grazing animals can destroy many desert plants and animals. Potassium cyanide used in gold mining may
        poison
        wildlife.
        <br><br>
        Off-road vehicles, when used irresponsibly, can cause irreparable damage to desert habitats. Oil and gas
        production
        may disrupt sensitive habitat. And nuclear waste may be dumped in deserts, which have also been used as nuclear
        testing grounds.

      <h1>Solutions</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        We can more efficiently use existing water resources and better control salinization to improve arid lands, find
        new
        ways to rotate crops to protect the fragile soil, and plant sand-fixing bushes and trees.
        <br><br>
        Planting leguminous plants, which extract nitrogen from the air and fix it in the ground, can help restore soil
        fertility. People can also use off-road vehicles only on designated trails and roadways and dig artificial
        grooves
        in
        the ground to retain rainfall and trap windblown seeds.
