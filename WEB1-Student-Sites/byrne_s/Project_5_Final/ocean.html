    <p class="oceanintro">Our oceans are facing a growing crisis — one that’s often hidden beneath the surface. 
      While dramatic oil spills grab headlines, the truth is that everyday human activity is causing far 
      greater harm. From plastic pollution and chemical runoff to noise and nutrient overload, the threats 
      to marine life are vast and varied. The facts below reveal just how serious the situation has become 
      — and why urgent action is needed to protect the world’s blue heart.</p>

      <h1 class="oceanh1">Some Quick Facts</h1>
      <br><br>
      <div class="fact">
        <h2>Oil spills aren’t the big(gest) problem</h2>
        <p>Headline-grabbing oil spills account for just 12 percent of the oil in our oceans. Two to three times as much
          oil
          is carried out to sea via runoff from our roads, rivers and drainpipes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>More plastic than fish</h2>
        <p>Up to 12 million metric tons: That’s how much plastic we dump into the oceans each year. That’s about 26
          billion
          pounds — or the equivalent of more than 100,000 blue whales — every single year. By 2050, ocean plastic will
          outweigh all of the ocean’s fish.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>5 garbage patches</h2>
        <p>There’s so much junk at sea, the debris has formed giant garbage patches. There are five of them around the
          world,
          and the largest — the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — includes an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of trash and
          covers
          an area twice the size of Texas.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>Plastic poses a double danger</h2>
        <p>Ocean plastic can be broken into smaller pieces — known as microplastics — by sun exposure and wave action,
          after
          which it can find its way into the food chain. When it eventually degrades (which can take hundreds of years
          in
          the case of a plastic bottle) the process releases chemicals that further contaminate the sea.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>Indonesia, India top the trash tally</h2>
        <p>More plastic in the ocean comes from Indonesia and India than anywhere else— together, they contribute more
          plastic to the world's coastal environments than the next seven countries combined, including the United
          States, which
          ranks third on the list.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>Pollution is in fashion (literally)</h2>
        <p>With each load of laundry, more than 700,000 synthetic microfibers can be washed into our waterways. Unlike
          natural materials such as cotton or wool, these plasticized fibers do not break down. One estimate puts the
          number of
          plastic microfibers in the ocean at 4 billion per square kilometer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>Tons of trash sits on the bottom</h2>
        <p>As unsightly as ocean pollution is, what we can’t see may be worse: Scientists estimate that some 14 million
          metric tons of ocean garbage actually rests on the seafloor, meaning we’re unlikely to ever be able to clean
          it up.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>Even nutrients can become harmful</h2>
        <p>When dumped at sea in large amounts, agricultural nutrients such as nitrogen can stimulate the explosive
          growth of
          algae. When the algae decompose, oxygen in the surrounding waters is consumed, creating a vast dead zone that
          can
          result in mass die-offs of fish and other marine life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>The number of dead zones is growing</h2>
        <p>In 2004, scientists counted 146 hypoxic zones (areas of such low oxygen concentration that animal life
          suffocates
          and dies) in the world’s oceans. By 2008, that number jumped to more than 400. In 2017, in the Gulf of Mexico,
          oceanographers detected a dead zone nearly the size of New Jersey — the largest dead zone ever measured at the
          time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>The oceans are losing mussel mass</h2>
        <p>One effect of greenhouse emissions is increased ocean acidification, which makes it more difficult for
          bivalves
          such as mussels, clams and oysters to form shells, decreasing their likelihood of survival, upsetting the food
          chain
          and impacting the multibillion-dollar shellfish industry.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="fact">
        <h2>We’re making a racket down there</h2>
        <p>Noise pollution generated by shipping and military activity can cause cellular damage to a class of
          invertebrates
          that includes jellyfish and anemones. These animals are a vital food source for tuna, sharks, sea turtles and
          other creatures.</p>
