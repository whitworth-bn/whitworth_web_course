    <h1 class="mountainh1">The Mountains</h1>

    <div class="mountaincontent">
      <h1>Mountains are the world’s water towers — and strongholds of biodiversity.</h1>
      <p>Most of the world’s rivers begin in the mountains. Because of their height, mountains act as water towers,
        diverting air masses and forcing them to rise, cool and fall as rain or snow. Water flowing from mountains
        doesn’t just
        provide essential drinking water; it also sustains food production for more than half of the world’s population.
        Rising
        temperatures attributed to climate change, however, could melt mountain glaciers at much faster rates, leading
        to more
        flooding and increased sedimentation and pollution of aquatic ecosystems, likely causing permanent damage.
        <br>
        Their inaccessibility has spared mountains somewhat from human encroachment and agricultural development, making
        them
        remote biological hotspots — diverse hubs of flora and fauna. Unfortunately these species aren’t safe from harm.
        As
        global average temperatures increase, many species will be forced to migrate up the mountain in search of cooler
        climes — and at some point there won’t be anywhere else for them to go.

      <h1>Mountainous cloud forests power major cities.</h1>
      <p>Cloud forests are vital to energy security in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Bogotá, which rely on
        hydroelectric dams to provide their electricity. Found at high elevations in mountainous regions, cloud forests
        catch
        rainfall and fogs that increase and regulate stream flows. Without healthy cloud forests, this water would
        likely
        return to the atmosphere without reaching rivers — which ultimately flow to hydropower dams downstream. Healthy
        cloud
        forests also limit the amount of sediment flowing into the water, prolonging the life of dams and improving
        their
        economic performance.
        <br>
        Without the unique montane climate and other conditions made possible by cloud forests, none of this filtration
        and
        regulation of fresh water would be possible. Any changes to the climate could affect these mountainous
        ecosystems,
        potentially reducing rainfall — and the provision of power to some of the world’s largest cities.

      <h1>Mountains make your morning coffee.</h1>
      <p>Coffee thrives on forested mountains, and Indonesia is among the largest coffee producers in the world, largely
        due to
        the unique conditions created by the country’s mountains. These “microclimates” are well suited for coffee
        production,
        an important source of income for many Indonesian farmers. But this livelihood is in peril — thanks to
        deforestation
        and climate change, Indonesia may soon face less rainfall and drier conditions unsuitable for coffee crops.
        <br>
        Despite these predicted ill effects on our coffee supply, all is not lost: Conservation International and others
        are
        working to improve agricultural practices and protect forests in order to make coffee a more resilient — and
        sustainable — crop.

      <h1>Mountains nurture one of the world’s most important foods.</h1>
      <p>Higher ground is a finite resource, a fact that potato farmers in Peru and other Andean countries know all too
        well.
        Normally grown at high altitudes, the potatoes of these montane areas are central to the Andean culture and
        diet.
        Potatoes originated in Peru, fed the Incan empire, and over the course of 8,000 years have morphed into 2,500
        different varieties. But during the past three decades, these potato farmers have slowly moved their crop to
        higher
        elevations in order to escape agricultural diseases and pests brought on by rising temperatures.
        <br>
        Ancient potato farming techniques involve planting a range of potato varieties across a large stretch of land to
        minimize risk of crop failure. Modern monoculture farming practices can allow for crop growth in warmer climates
        through the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers; however, these chemicals present risks to human health
        and
        threaten the genetic diversity of potatoes. (The Irish potato famine in the mid-1800s illustrates what can
        happen when
        you only plant one kind of potato.)
        <br>
        Seeds from ancient potato species were recently added to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. Maintaining
        the
        genetic diversity of potatoes increases the likelihood of preserving a species that may be more resistant to
        pests and
        disease — or higher temperatures.

      <h1>Mountains may be getting more dangerous for climbers.</h1>
      <p>Each year, thousands risk their lives to attempt a climb of Mount Everest, a dangerous pursuit with a US$
        50,000 price
        tag. There is no guarantee of success, but these climbers accept the many risks to ascend some of the world’s
        most
        formidable slopes in hopes of summiting Earth’s highest peak, and gazing upon the world below. But this
        adventure soon
        may be coming to an end.
        <br>
        Rising temperatures brought by a changing climate are causing snow and ice to melt on Everest, leading to more
        avalanches and increased rock-falls, such as the 2014 avalanche that killed 16 climbers. Consequently, the
        danger of
        climbing the world’s tallest mountain may be increasing — not just for the tourists, but also for the Nepali
        mountain
        guides whose jobs put them at more frequent risk.
        <br>
        The massive glaciers that reside on top of the mountain may also cause greater landslides and flooding in the
        surrounding areas, endangering the lives of the millions of people living nearby. Currently, Everest is on track
        for a
        glacial loss of at least 70% by 2100.
