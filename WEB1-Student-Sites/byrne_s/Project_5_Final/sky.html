        <p>The atmosphere is Earth’s invisible shield — a life-sustaining envelope of gases that keeps temperatures
          stable, air breathable, and ecosystems thriving. But this delicate system is under increasing strain. From the
          scorching cautionary tale of Venus to radical ideas like space mirrors and the invisible threat of
          pollen-choked
          air, our understanding of Earth's atmosphere — and the forces shaping it — has never been more urgent. This
          page
          explores the science, consequences, and potential solutions surrounding one of the most critical challenges of
          our time: protecting the air we depend on.

        <h1>Could Earth become more like Venus? Let’s not find out.</h1>
        <p>Earth is the only planet in the solar system with an atmosphere that can sustain life as we know it. But it
          could have been very different — as evidenced by Venus. Superficially the closest planet to Earth in terms of
          size and proximity to the sun, the atmospheres of early Earth and Venus were not drastically different, yet
          today Earth is hospitable to life and Venus is a highly pressurized hotbox with an average daily temperature of
          around 460 degrees Celsius (860 degrees Fahrenheit). Scientists believe that the sun may have “cooked off”
          Venus’ water vapor, leaving only carbon dioxide — while the slightly cooler Earth retained its water (while
          hosting living organisms that consumed carbon and produced oxygen), enough to tip the scales to an atmosphere
          beneficial for life.
          Now, humans are upsetting that delicate balance by pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at an
          unprecedented pace, particularly over the last 50 years. The last time there was this much carbon in the
          atmosphere, humans didn’t exist. These CO2 levels are causing severe weather fluctuations, longer periods of
          drought and flooding, and more frequent and intense storms. While it’s unlikely that our planet could ever see
          an atmosphere like Venus, the history of our planetary neighbor is a cautionary tale to humans: Take care of
          your air.

        <h1>Some scientists want to use giant space mirrors to fight climate change — but not everyone thinks this is a good idea.</h1>
        <p>Revolutionary climate engineering technologies might be the missing piece to the puzzle that can help us meet
          the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. By the time the agreement goes into effect in 2020, the
          planet’s warming may have outpaced the plan to manage it. This has led some scientists to propose new — and
          sometimes polarizing — technologies, like artificial “trees” that would perform the same carbon-capturing duties
          as real trees. Another idea is solar radiation management technology, a type of climate engineering that
          reflects sunlight (and heat) back into space, thereby reducing the temperature on Earth.
          Climate engineering technologies like this are meant to replace the services the atmosphere — and nature —
          provide for free. Yet, as their detractors point out, their benefits are limited. For example, giant space
          mirrors don’t address dangerous impacts of a warming climate, such as ocean acidification — only the warming
          itself.

        <h1>You’re not imagining it — it is getting harder to breathe.</h1>
        <p>You can thank climate change: The duration of seasons and more erratic weather patterns are causing plants to
          release more pollen into the air earlier and for longer periods. If you’re one of the lucky people who doesn’t
          currently suffer from seasonal allergies, that might change soon. The longer you’re exposed to an allergen (such
          as pollen floating around for an extended period), the more likely you are to develop sensitivity to it.
          Although for most people allergies are a seasonal annoyance, air quality causes damaging health effects for
          millions around the world. Asthma rates have soared in the past decade due to air pollution and higher temperatures;
          today about 235 million people suffer from it worldwide, and over 80% of asthma deaths occur in low- and lower-middle
          income countries. Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that 3.7 million people die each year due to
          air pollution.

        <h1>The eruption of one volcano can change the global temperature.</h1>
        <p>When volcanoes erupt, they spew particles and gases into the air, which have different effects. Ash and sulfur
          dioxide cause a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight away from the planet, while carbon dioxide causes warming
          by contributing to the greenhouse effect (trapping heat energy).
          Some scientists believe that the Earth has maintained a relatively even climate for so long due to the heating and
          cooling caused by volcanic eruptions, going so far as to say climate change would be worse if not for the cooling
          episodes provided by certain eruptions. The effects are considerable: After Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
          erupted in 1991, average global temperatures dropped about a degree Fahrenheit for two years; the 1815 eruption of
          Tambora in Indonesia brought a dip in temperatures that caused crop failures in North America and Europe.

        <h1>Seeing through clouds = a win for science.</h1>
        <p>The ability to scan Earth via satellite — known as “remote sensing” — has expanded considerably our
          understanding of climate, forests, farming and more. But for years, scientists in tropical regions were hampered by cloud cover,
          which obscured views from satellites and made precise monitoring and mapping of land difficult.
          A relatively new open-source data platform that relies on old technology — radar — has changed all that,
          penetrating all weather conditions and returning high-resolution images and data.
          For scientific organizations such as Conservation International, this tool is helping to illuminate land-cover
          change. With this technology, researchers are better able to observe when forests are cleared for farms and
          other uses in places such as Indonesia and Peru. Combined with optical satellite data (think Google Earth), scientists
          are able to get the full picture of what’s happening on the ground, then use the findings to inform conservation
          efforts and policy decisions.
